#GitHub User Avatar Finder Web App

#Objective:

Develop a web application using React that allows users to input a GitHub username. Upon user input, the app
should display the avatar of the user fetched from the GitHub API. The app should incorporate debouncing to
enhance user experience and prevent excessive API calls. To implement debouncing, create a custom hook
called useDebounce.

#User Interface (UI):

The user should be able to type in a GitHub username in the input box.
GitHub API Integration:
Utilize the GitHub API to fetch user information, specifically the user's avatar image.
Handle API requests and responses effectively.

#Avatar Display:
 Upon successful API response, display the user's avatar image in the designated container.

#Debouncing: Implement debouncing to improve performance and prevent excessive API calls while the user is 
typing in the input box
